final 
class:cannot extend ;wrapper class
var:cnt change the ref;local instance static
method ;cannot override


abstract
keyword; just a thoughts not a reality; incomplete thought
if a class is not complete and we want to add some functionality in future
used in class and method
ex:
puvlic abstract class Demo{
it has 11 methods 
can use as car or parent(inherit) ;cannot crate instance in runner;
abstract calss hav constructor;but i cant use in new keyword
it means v can do only chaining but cant create copy bcz its abstract or incomplete

v can complete the abstract clas  using sub class
now i can create instance or create a copy

abstract mehods do not hav body and ens in semicolon
and need to be overridden in subclass only then only we can call in runner
abstract cannot declasre as private

if v declare method as abstract we nedd to do class as abstract
